## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The overlay is missing!**  
A: Go to **General** settings and ensure "Show Hardware Overlay" is toggled **ON**.

**Q: Why doesn't the app start with Windows?**  
A: Ensure "Launch on Windows Startup" is enabled. Note that this requires the app to remain in the same folder where you first enabled the setting.

**Q: Windows says "Unknown Publisher" or "SmartScreen" prevents it from running.**  
A: This happens because the app is a local, independent release. Click **"More Info"** and then **"Run Anyway"**. The app is 100% safe and builds are verified via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kil0bit-kb/kil0bit-system-monitor/actions).

**Q: My network speed shows 0 KB/s.**  
A: In **Monitoring** settings, select the correct active Network Adapter from the dropdown menu.
